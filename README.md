## About the Project

This Unreal Engine project provides a **highly scalable inventory system**, designed to be **quick to set up** and **easy to extend**.

The main goal is to allow developers to **create a fully functional inventory grid in just a few clicks**, with support for multiple inventory types:

* **Single-slot inventory** (classic grid-based inventory)
* **Multi-slot inventory** (items occupying multiple cells, similar to a Tetris-style inventory)

The system is built with modularity in mind, making it easy to add new inventory types, rules, or item behaviors without rewriting core logic.

## Features

* ✅ Create inventories **in just a few clicks** (grid + UI + logic)
* ✅ Support for **single-slot** and **multi-slot** items
* ✅ **Highly scalable** architecture (multiple inventories, custom sizes, custom rules)
* ✅ Configurable items (size, icon, stackability, etc.)
* ✅ Ready-to-use UI (grid, hover, optional drag & drop)
* ✅ Easily attachable to players, chests, vendors, or any actor
